  <br><b>An open source image forensic toolset</b>
</p>

# Introduction
"*Forensic Image Analysis is the application of image science and domain expertise to interpret the content of an image and/or the image itself in legal matters. Major subdisciplines of Forensic Image Analysis with law enforcement applications include: Photogrammetry, Photographic Comparison, Content Analysis, and Image Authentication.*" (Scientific Working Group on Imaging Technologies)

**Sherloq** is a personal research project about implementing a fully integrated environment for digital image forensics. It is not meant as an automatic tool that decide if an image is forged or not (that tool probably will never exist...), but as a companion in experimenting with various algorithms found in the latest research papers and workshops.

While many commercial solutions have high retail prices and often reserved to law enforcement and government agencies only, this toolset aims to be a both an extensible framework and a starting point for anyone interested in making experiments in this particular application of digital signal processing.

I strongly believe that *security-by-obscurity* is the wrong way to offer any kind of forensic service (i.e. "Using this proprietary software I guarantee you that this photo *is* pristine... and you have to trust me!"). Following the open-source philosophy, everyone should be able to try various techniques on their own, gain knowledge and share it to the community... even better if they contribute with code improvements! :)

# History
The first version was written in 2015 using C++11 to build a command line utility with many options, but soon it turned to be too cumbersome and not much interactive. That version could be compiled with CMake after installing OpenCV, Boost and AlgLib libraries. This first proof of concept offered about 80% of planned features (see below for the full list).

While also including novel algorithms, the 2017 version mainly added a Qt-based multi-window GUI to provide a better user experience. Multiple analyses could be shown on screen and a fast zoom/scroll  viewer was implemented for easier image navigation. That project could be compiled with Qt Creator with Qt 5 and OpenCV 3 and covered about 70% of planned features.

Fast forward to 2020 when I decided to port everything in Python (PySide2 + Matplotlib + OpenCV) for easier development and deployment. While this iteration is just begun and I have yet to port all the previous code on the new platform, I think this will be the final "form" of the project (as long as someone does not volunteer up to develop a nice web application!).

I'm happy to share my code and get in contact with anyone interested to improve or test it, but please keep in mind that this repository is *not* intended for distributing a final product, my aim is just to publicly track development of an *unpretentious educational tool*, so expect bugs, unpolished code and missing features! ;)

# Features
This list contains the functions that the toolkit will (hopefully) provide once beta stage is reached (**NOTE:** functions displayed in _italics_ inside the program are not yet implemented!).

- __Pixel Statistics__: compute minimum/maximum/average RGB values for every pixel

### Noise
- __Noise Separation__: estimate and extract different kind of image noise components
- __Min/Max Deviation__: highlight pixels deviating from block-based min/max statistics
- __Bit Planes Values__: show individual bit planes to find inconsistent noise patterns
- __PRNU Identification__: exploit sensor pattern noise introduced by different cameras

### JPEG
- __Quality Estimation__: extract quantization tables and estimate last saved JPEG quality
- __Error Level Analysis__: show pixel-level difference against fixed compression levels
- __Multiple Compression__: use a machine learning model to detect multiple compression
- __JPEG Ghost Maps__: highlight traces of different compression levels in difference images

### Tampering
- __Contrast Enhancement__: analyze color distribution to detect contrast enhancements
- __Copy-Move Forgery__: use invariant feature descriptors for cloned area detection
- __Composite Splicing__: exploit DCT statistics for automatic splicing zone detection
- __Image Resampling__: estimate 2D pixel interpolation for detecting resampling traces

### Various
- __Median Filtering__: detect processing traces left by nonlinear median filtering
- __Illuminant Map__: estimate scene local light direction on estimated 3D surfaces
- __Dead/Hot Pixels__: detect and fix dead/hot pixels caused by sensor imperfections
- __Stereogram Decoder__: decode 3D images concealed in crossed-eye autostereograms

# Installation

For more information about Python Virtual Environments, you can read [here](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) or [here](https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/09/04/python-virtual-environments/).

## [1/2] Virtual environment

### Linux
```
$ sudo apt install python3-distutils python3-dev python3-testresources subversion
$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
$ sudo python3 get-pip.py
$ sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
$ echo -e "\n# Python Virtual Environments" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ mkvirtualenv sq -p python3
```

### MacOS

1) Open Terminal and enter `python3 --version` to install the interpreter and other command line tools
2) Once installed, proceed similarly to Linux installation:
```
   $ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
   $ sudo python3 get-pip.py
   $ sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
   $ echo -e "\n# Python Virtual Environments" >> ~/.bash_profile
   $ echo "export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs" >> ~/.bash_profile
   $ echo "export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3" >> ~/.bash_profile
   $ echo "source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile
   $ source ~/.bash_profile
```
3) Create a new Python 3 virtual environment:
```
$ mkvirtualenv sq -p python3
```
4) Install `libmagic` via `brew` (thanks to @thmsl):
```
   $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   $ brew install libmagic
```

### Windows
1. Download latest *Python* setup package from [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. Install ensuring that "Add Python to PATH" and "PIP installation" are enabled
1. Open *Command Prompt* and enter the following commands:
```
> pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper-win
> mkvirtualenv sq
```

### Conda
1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (one can also install miniconda, no GUI but is smaller)
1. Install Xinerama library: `sudo apt-get install libxcb-xinerama0`
1. Open a console to create a Python environment (on Windows one must start a Conda Console or `sth` from the Start menu):
`conda create --copy -n sherloq python` [enter *Yes* when it prompts]
1. After install ends, type in the same console `conda activate sherloq` to activate the environment 

## [2/2] Launch program
1. Clone the repository content into a local folder
1. Change current directory to the `gui` folder inside `sherloq`
1. Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages (use `pip install -r requirements_win.txt` on Windows)
1. Launch the GUI with `python sherloq.py`

# Updates
When a new version is released, update the local working copy using Git, SVN or manually downloading from this repository and (if necessary) update the packages in the virtual environment following [this guide](https://www.activestate.com/resources/quick-reads/how-to-update-all-python-packages/).
